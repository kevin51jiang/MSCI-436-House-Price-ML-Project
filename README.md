# MSCI-436-House-Price-ML-Project
This repository holds our linear regression ML model python program as well as the basic application script we have using Streamlit. It is a basic Decision Support Tool to help with understanding house pricing based on multiple factors.


## Streamlit
First, enter into venv and install requirements.txt. Then:

1. Make dummy model 
    ```shell
    python .\make_dummy_model.py`
   ```
2. Run Streamlit 
   ```shell
    streamlit run dash.py`
    ```
